## Goal of this project:
This project meant to embed a pdf in pgVector store database so that we can ask we questions about the book (The application I wish I had in college !). The initial version will use openAi's models but in the future would like to try more open source models.

üóíÔ∏è This project is inspired by [Dan Vega's SpringAi PgVector Rag Tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZoPVGrB8iHU?si=Fqxy8QPgkey1lmoM)

## How to run:

1. This project requires docker compose support or docker desktop to consume the compose.yml ![docker compose support image](dockercomposesupport.png) **Note** if you start both you may run  into issues- [see common issues](https://github.com/Alewis103/PDFRAG/blob/master/readme.md#common-issues)
2. Start services before running application this should create the vector db using the schema ddl and the compose.yml ![intellij services image](intellijservicesrunning.png)




### Common issues
#### PSQLException: FATAL: password authentication failed for user

For this I referred to some really useful stackoverflow posts: 
1. [How to configure PostgreSQL to accept all incoming connections](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3278379/how-to-configure-postgresql-to-accept-all-incoming-connections)
2. [Java Springboot application returning password authentication failed for user](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45400538/java-springboot-application-returning-password-authentication-failed-for-user-p)
3. [If you're on windows you may need to kill duplicate processes](https://nerdschalk.com/how-to-kill-a-process-on-port-on-windows-11/)

4. [Sometimes you may have to kill the postgreSql Server in the background, this can be done simply using task manager if you're on windows](postgresKill.png)


After these four I was able to get passed that pesky error
